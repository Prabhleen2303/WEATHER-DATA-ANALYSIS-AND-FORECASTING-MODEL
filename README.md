# WEATHER-DATA-ANALYSIS-AND-FORECASTING-MODEL
The Weather Data Analysis and Forecasting Model is a machine learning project designed to analyze past weather patterns and predict future conditions. It processes raw CSV weather data, cleans and structures it using Python, Pandas, and SQLite, and performs detailed analysis of temperature and rainfall trends over the past week.  

The notebook includes feature engineering steps such as lag and rolling averages to capture temporal patterns, followed by training regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor (SVR). These models are evaluated using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R² to identify the most accurate predictors for next-day (8th day) weather forecasting.  

All development was done in Jupyter Notebook within VS Code, with clear version tracking through Git commits — from data preparation and visualization to model training and next-day prediction. This project demonstrates how data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling can be combined to create a reliable weather forecasting system.
